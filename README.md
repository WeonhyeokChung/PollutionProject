Using RD to identify causal effect of PM on Search

Summary: Tn this file I use region by pollution running variable and covariates to estimate effect of pollution information on actual search in Korea.

Previous Steps: Use pollution data from AirKorea and search data from Naver Data Lab. Create running variable for pollution information. Then I restrict days when the running variable is between -20 and 20.
